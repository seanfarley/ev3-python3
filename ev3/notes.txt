BEFORE I FORGET:

- Needed more micro-usb powercords (must have forgot some in the office)
- More "building up" a command:
  - go from sending a raw command
  - to changing LED (built-in to ev3)
  - to finding the connected device (wheel)
  - to moving the wheel
- One person was clearly not able to do much and left early since his partner was kind of way more advanced and finished the code for them both; not sure what to do with this situation
- One person with linux could not connect to the ev3s nor nanos (but could connect to the internet??)
- Same linux machine couldn't use HID because of udev; fucking YEAR OF THE LINUX DESKTOP
- Need to remove the threading code because 1) it doesn't work and 2) is wayyyyy easier to explain time.sleep
- Need to improve finding the other sensors (push button, IR, echo, etc.)
- More explanation of the opencv bounding boxes and doing the math
- Fix turning to make it easier and more straight-forward (ha! the puns)
